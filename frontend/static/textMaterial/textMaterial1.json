    "content": "<p>Alcohols can be oxidized to form aldehydes, ketones, or carboxylic acids. The oxidation product depends on the type of alcohol:</p><ul><li><strong>Primary alcohols</strong> (R-CH₂OH) oxidize to aldehydes (R-CHO) and further to carboxylic acids (R-COOH).</li><li><strong>Secondary alcohols</strong> (R-CHOH-R) oxidize to ketones (R-CO-R).</li><li><strong>Tertiary alcohols</strong> (R-C(OH)-R₂) do not undergo oxidation because they lack a hydrogen atom on the carbon bearing the hydroxyl (-OH) group.</li></ul><p>Common oxidizing agents include:</p><ul><li>Potassium dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇) in acidic medium.</li><li>PCC (pyridinium chlorochromate), which is used to stop oxidation at the aldehyde stage.</li></ul>"
